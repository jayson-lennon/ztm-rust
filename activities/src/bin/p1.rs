// Project 1: Interactive bill manager
//
// Summary:
//   Create a command line bills/expenses manager that runs
//   interactively. This mini project brings together many of
//   the concepts learn thus far into a single application.
//
//   The user stories/requirements are split into stages.
//   Fully implement each stage as a complete working program
//   before making changes for the next stage. Leverage the
//   compiler by using `cargo check --bin p1` when changing
//   between stages to help identify adjustments that need
//   to be made.
//
// User stories:
// * Stage 1:
//   - I want to add bills, including the name and amount owed.
//   - I want to view existing bills.
// * Stage 2:
//   - I want to remove bills.
// * Stage 3:
//   - I want to edit existing bills.
//   - I want to go back if I change my mind.
//
// Tips:
// * Use the loop keyword to create an interactive menu.
// * Each menu choice should be it's own function, so you can work on the
//   the functionality for that menu in isolation.
// * A vector is the easiest way to store the bills at stage 1, but a
//   hashmap will be easier to work with at stages 2 and 3.
